1. userIsAdmin → True if userId > 65536

2. usernameValid → True if the username has at least 3 characters

3. passwordValid → True if the password:

4. contains at least one of the characters $, |, or @

5. and is at least 20 characters long for admins, otherwise 16

# Activity 14:
The program:

1. Asks the user to enter username, password, and userId

2. Checks if the username and password follow the rules

3. Prints messages to the console:

Access granted if both are valid

Error messages if something is invalid
